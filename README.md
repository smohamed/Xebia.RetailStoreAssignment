# Xebia.RetailStoreAssignment

Changes:
	- All projects retargeted .NET Framework 4.6.2
	- Created to new projects (Xebia.OnlineStore and Xebia.OnlineStore.Core) that contain new code.
	- Xebia.OnlineStore.Core contains all interfaces that constitute the solution design and architecture.
	- Xebia.OnlineStore contains the actual implementation on the above design (here you can find few design patterns along with OOP/OOD principals used across the code).
	- It's very easy to change/replace any part of the solution with no impact on the other parts as far as you keep the public API surface intact.
	- Test project remains almost the same with minimal change to accommodate the new public API.
